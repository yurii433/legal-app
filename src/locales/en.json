Fortunately, I found the company Fin-Velsta on the internet; at first, I was worried, but in the end, within 5 or 6 days, the senior lawyer returned the money, even collected moral damages of $700 from these scammers.",

I mortgaged my apartment and car, and during the work, I had a thought that maybe this is a scam. I accidentally came across the company Fin-Velsta, contacted me with a fairly reasonable guy, Victor, explained everything and said not to work with them anymore. After 2 weeks, we ate up to the last penny all my lost money.",

Immediately on the recommendation of a friend, I turned to Fin-Velsta; the refund process was very difficult. Several times I thought I would wave my hand to my money, but with fights, I managed to get the money back. Now, if something happens, I immediately contact Fin-Velsta.",

It happened that last summer I contacted a company and supposedly traded with a financial analyst. How many times I begged him to withdraw the money, only to hear that money is needed, money is needed. I was already desperate and resigned to the fact that I would live in debt for the rest of my life.",
    "review-client-comment-3-1": "But when my son-in-law, an IT specialist, recommended me the company Fin-Velsta from Switzerland, I decided to try it. They provided me with a lawyer, Aneta, who is just like a shark in the water, understands all the intricacies of refunds. In the end, I went on vacation to Thailand with the money that Aneta returned to me. God bless such lawyers as her and a big thank you to the company Fin-Velsta.",
